# Boat Destroyer

This game was inspired by a higher power! However, it is also very simple, silly, and could 
even be considered stupid. Meh. 

Boats travel from the bottom of the screen up to the horizon. The player must click on the boats
to destroy them. Every boat destroyed adds to the score while every boat missed decreases the 
score. The boats go quickly, so be fast.
